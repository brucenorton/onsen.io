### Reducing App Size

Here are listed some tips for reducing the size of Onsen UI apps.

#### Removing icon packs

Since **v2.8.0** it is possible to remove default icon packs originally bundled inside Onsen UI (Font Awesome, Ionicons and Material Design icons). A new `onsenui-core.css` file is provided which can be included **instead of** `onsenui.css` (and their minified versions):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/onsenui/css/onsenui-core.min.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/onsenui/css/onsen-css-components.min.css">
```

See also [How can I use custom icon packs?](faq.html#how-can-i-use-custom-icon-packs) section for related information.

#### ES Modules

Onsen UI core is distributed as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) bundle (Universal Module Definition). This bundle file contains every element provided in the library together with all the internals (`ons` object and the like). This is great for simple environments, i.e. directly dropping it in `index.html` as `<script src="path/to/onsenui.js"></script>`.

However, for users who already have a build system with a bundler tool such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/), since **v2.8.0**, Onsen UI is also provided as [ES Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import). This means that **every element becomes a separate and independent module that can be optionally imported**. There are some common stuff that must be included as well (`ons` object and necessary interal logic) but, generally speaking, it is possible to leave out a bunch of non required elements and reduce the app's size. Onsen UI components are already quite small but, especially for PWA, this could be a good plus.

All the modules are already transpiled to ES5 and use standard ES `import` and `export`. Therefore, there is no need to use any transpiler/compiler like Babel or Buble. Just tell the bundler where the files are located.

Assuming Onsen UI has been installed and is available in `node_modules` (or any other place as long as the bundler is aware of it), an example in ESM environment would be as follows:

```js
import ons from 'onsenui/esm';
import 'onsenui/esm/elements/ons-page';
import 'onsenui/esm/elements/ons-toolbar';
import 'onsenui/esm/elements/ons-button';
import 'onsenui/esm/elements/ons-navigator';
```

That's it! Now a simplified version of `ons` which does not register any element by default is available in the current scope. It is not registered globally either in order to avoid global pollution, so just run `window.ons = ons;` if needed (or additionally include it in other scopes).

> Make sure you import `ons` from `onsenui/esm`, not from `onsenui`. Otherwise, every element will be directly included.

The previous code adds `ons-page`, `ons-toolbar`, `ons-button` and `ons-navigator` to the app, there is no need to do anything else. **Elements should only be included once** (because they are globally registered as Custom Elements).

> `ons.notification` utilities rely on `ons-alert-dialog` and `ons-toast`, so make sure these elements are imported once before calling `ons.notification`.

If the app requires almost every element in Onsen UI, the UMD bundle would still be preferred since it can be minified more efficiently.

##### Why is it so verbose?

Because, in this way, **we do not rely on tree shaking algorithms**. Otherwise:

```
import { page, toolbar, button, navigator } from 'onsenui/esm/elements'; // Does not work!
```

This is in fact a possible syntax but it relies on tree shaking algorithms to drop all the other components. Unfortunately, tree shaking algorithms don't play well with some transpiled code like `Object.defineProperty` (generated by Babel when transpiling ES2015 classes). Therefore, it is safer to don't rely on them for this purpose currently.
